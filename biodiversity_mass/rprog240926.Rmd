## Background: 30x30 goal 

The [30x30 goal](https://www.campaignfornature.org/Background) is a global conservation initiative aimed at protecting 30% of the planetâ€™s land and oceans by 2030. It seeks to safeguard biodiversity, mitigate climate change, and promote ecosystem resilience by preserving critical habitats and ecosystems. Endorsed by numerous countries, including the United States, and environmental organizations, the goal aims to halt the rapid loss of nature, restore degraded environments, and support Indigenous and local communities whose livelihoods depend on healthy ecosystems. By setting this target, 30x30 hopes to ensure long-term sustainability and environmental health for future generations.

[Rosa and Malcom (2020)](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2PRDY) performed a multi-scale analyses that compares protected area GAP status, endangered species richness, and carbon sequestration potential. Their analysis demonstrates that 30x30 is numerically achievable nationally, but high spatial heterogeneity highlights the need for tailored approaches from a mix of authorities at federal, regional and state scales.

Only GAP 1 and 2 are typically considered protected. However, GAP 3 areas are governed under multipleuse
mandates (e.g., wildlife, forestry and mining) and may have particular potential to advance biodiversity and climate protections more quickly through administrative mechanisms ([Rosa and Malcom, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2PRDY)).

## Proportion of Protected Land in Massachuetts

In Massachusetts, only about 5% of the land and 1.5% of the ocean are protected from logging and mining, a far cry from the 30% nationwide pledge. 

Massachuetts protected areas (GAP 1+2 = 5.6%) and GAP3 = 11.2%, most is under state management [Source: United States Geological Survey (USGS) Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) https://maps.usgs.gov/padusdataexplorer/#/protected-areas] 

```{r}
# GAP 1+2
map %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% filter(GAP_Sts < 3) %>% 
  summarize(sum = sum(GIS_Acres)) %>% calc_prop()

# GAP 1-3
map %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% filter(GAP_Sts < 4) %>% 
  summarize(sum = sum(GIS_Acres)) %>% calc_prop()

## Pending Action by Massachuetts Government

Healey establishes biodiversity goals with (executive order)[https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-celebrates-climate-week-by-establishing-nations-first-long-term-biodiversity-goals-single-use-plastic-bottle-ban], which directs the state to develop biodiversity goals for 2030, 2040, and 2050. The [administration celebrates](https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/09/21/massachusetts-conservation-biodiversity) itselves, because Massachusetts is the first state to set metrics out to 2050, and the first on the East Coast to include coastal and marine biodiversity. However, the deadline to make a plan was missed. 

Moreover, Healey did not renew logging moratorium on state land, which [expired Jan 5th, 2024](https://www.nepm.org/regional-news/2024-01-05/massachusetts-issues-climate-forestry-report-ends-tree-cutting-pause-loggers-want-work-to-begin). She was critized as it did not allow "climate-smart" management/interventions.
